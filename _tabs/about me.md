Hi, I'm Michael.  I am currently a student at the <span><img src="/assets/img/penn/upenn-emblem.png" alt="UPenn emblem" style="width: 0.9em; display: block; margin: auto;"></span> [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/).  I study CIS (computer science) and will graduate in 2026.

I was born in Houston, TX and now live in Pennsylvania.

&larr; This picture was taken somewhere off the coast of New Jersey.  The sky looks good because it had just rained (if you look closely my shirt is soaked).

Side note: "migaol" is not a typo.  It's supposed to be "Miguel", the Spanish/Portuguese derivation of "Michael", but I put my last name in the middle.

I don't really know what else to put here.
